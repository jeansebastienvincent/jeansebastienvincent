- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jeansebastienvincent
- ðŸ‘€ Since early 2019 I reconverted myself to software developper. Before I was with Pwc during 10 years, I was the financial guy at two medical device startups, and I was and still am the personal advisor of the owner of a logistics company.
- ðŸŒ± But today my passion is software development, with a focus on javascript and react.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at info@jsvincent.com
